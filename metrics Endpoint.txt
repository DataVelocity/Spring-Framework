 /metrics Endpoint
The metrics endpoint publishes information about OS and JVM as well as application-level metrics. Once enabled, we get information such as memory, heap, processors, threads, classes loaded, classes unloaded, and thread pools, along with some HTTP metrics as well.

The /health endpoint is used to check the health or state of the running application.
/health shows application health information (a simple status when accessed over an unauthenticated connection or full message details when authenticated); it’s not sensitive by default.
/info displays arbitrary application info; it’s not sensitive by default.
/metrics shows metrics information for the current application; it’s sensitive by default.
/trace displays trace information (by default, the last few HTTP requests).
